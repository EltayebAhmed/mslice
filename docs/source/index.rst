Welcome to MSlice's documentation!
==================================

Mslice is a tool for visualizing cuts and slices from neutron powder diffraction data. It uses `Mantid <http://mantidproject.org>`_ to process the data and plots it using `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. It is a GUI tool but also has a python interface for those who want to script the process.
